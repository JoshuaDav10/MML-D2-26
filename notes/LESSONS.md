# Decomp Lessons — accumulated compiler & workflow knowledge

Running log of what's been *proven against the hash* (not theorized). Every
future session should read this before matching. Add to it whenever a diff
iteration teaches something; this file is how the project gets smarter.

## How knowledge persists between sessions
- `CLAUDE.md` — auto-loaded rules (build commands, gotchas, branch policy).
- This file — compiler idioms and matching tactics, growing per session.
- `include/rock_neo/*.h` — struct layouts are *executable knowledge*: once a
  field is typed (e.g. MOJI_TASK.script), every later function gets it free.
- `progress.md` / `activity.md` — counters and per-session narrative.
- Git history on `dev` — each commit message records what matched and why.

## cc1-27 (GCC 2.7.2) codegen facts — verified byte-for-byte

1. **Function emission order**: at -O1+ all compiled C bodies are deferred to
   the end of the TU, after every top-level `__asm__` block. Fixed by the
   reorder pass in `tools/patchasm.py` (moves bodies to their in-place
   `.globl` markers). `static` functions have no marker — avoid `static`.

2. **Global addressing (-G8)**:
   - `extern s8 foo;` (scalar ≤8 bytes) → `$gp`-relative access (`lw v0,offset($gp)`).
   - `extern u8 foo[];` (unsized array) → `lui`/`%lo` addressing.
   - Read the target asm first: `lui`+`lw` means declare as unsized array (or
     a >8-byte struct); `($gp)` means declare as a plain scalar.
   - A pointer global accessed via lui: declare `extern T *foo[];` and use `foo[0]`.

3. **Swap/temp-variable ordering drives register allocation.** For a byte swap,
   `t = x[a]; x[a] = x[b]; x[b] = t;` matched; the equivalent
   "load both into temps, then store both" form produced mirrored registers
   (addu operand order + which sum lands in a0). Write the *idiomatic* form
   first; only get creative when the diff says so.

4. **Statement order ≈ evaluation order, but the scheduler interleaves.**
   `m->x10 += 0xC; m->script += 1;` emitted lhu/lw/addiu/addiu/sh/sw —
   both statements' loads hoisted together. Don't fight interleaving; match
   the *statement* order to the first-use order in the asm.

5. **Aliasing blocks CSE**: `m->x3E = m->script[1]; m->script += 2;` loads
   `m->script` twice (sb through the struct may alias the pointer field), so
   two back-to-back `lw`s of the same field in asm ≠ a weird source construct.

6. **Return-value-in-delay-slot** (`jr ra` / `addiu v0,zero,N`) is just
   `return N;`. `addu v0,zero,zero` in the slot is `return 0;`.

7. **`li` vs `addiu`**: patchasm already rewrites `li reg,<0xFFFF` to addiu
   (assembler would emit ori otherwise). Existing behavior; keep it.

## Known struct facts
- **MOJI_TASK** (moji.c, arg to the func_8005xxxx family): 0x10 u16, 0x14
  `u8* script` (a script/text stream — most tiny moji funcs advance it),
  0x3E s8, 0x6C s32, 0x72 s8, 0x78 s8. The +N accessor families are script
  opcode handlers, which sizes their operands.
- **GAME_WORK.x53** at 0x53 (u8 counter, func_8001D974 increments it).
- **PL_WORK.rb_parts_sort_data** at 0x454, u8[0x20].
- Cd sentinel: `unknown_Cd_strucptr != &D_800A3A40` = "read not done" (Cd_read_sync2).

## Workflow tactics that worked
- Harvest sibling families together (12 moji accessors in one verified batch).
- One rebuild+hash validates an entire batch AND any refactor of prior
  matches simultaneously — refactoring to structs is cheap, do it early.
- When a function mismatches, the binary diff (`build/rock_neo.diff`)
  isolates WHICH function; then reason about the shape difference (register
  mirroring → reorder temps; extra/missing nop → aliasing or scheduling).

## Verification ritual (anti-hallucination)
- A batch is DONE only when `make CPP=cpp check_rock_neo_only` prints OK.
- Ground truth: `cmp disks/us/ROCK_NEO.EXE build/rock_neo.exe` — direct
  byte comparison, no hashing, no trust required.
- Liveness audit (prove the C is really in the binary): deliberately break a
  matched function (`+1` → `+2`), rebuild — check MUST fail; revert — OK.
  If breaking the C didn't break the build, the C wasn't being compiled in.
